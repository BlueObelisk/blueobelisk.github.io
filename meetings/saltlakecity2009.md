Our Blue Obelisk meeting in Salt Lake City is taking shape. 

It's set up at Martine for 10 people, Wed 25 March, 7pm 

The [Martine is a tapas place](http://www.dininginutah.com/martine.htm) is located one block south of Temple Square on 100 South between Main and State Streets, 2 blocks east of the convention center 

Thanks to Rajarshi for setting this up. 

This place is *very* limited in space, at it seems, so we cannot do it like in Boston, where many more people showed up than expected. So if you like to join (which would be great!), please let us know by emailing to [blueobelisk-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net](mailto:blueobelisk-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net)

So far we've got confirmations from 

  1. Martin Walker 
  2. Henry Rzepa 
  3. Warren DeLano 
  4. Rajarshi Guha 
  5. Christoph Steinbeck 
  6. Robert E. Belford 
  7. Kyle Yancey 
  8. Jon Holmes
